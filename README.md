A fun & challenging puzzle visualizer that places uniquely shaped pieces onto a 6x9 board ‚Äî while revealing **today‚Äôs date** through open slots. Inspired by [@the_puzzle_guy](https://www.instagram.com/the_puzzle_guy/) pentomino puzzles, this project uses backtracking to find valid solutions each day!

## üß† How It Works

- The board is a static 6x9 grid with **53 fixed positions**.
- The solver leaves 3 specific blocks empty to show the **date, month, and day**.
- It uses a recursive **backtracking algorithm** to fit the remaining pieces.
- A custom **Top-left Empty Cell Heuristic** helps optimize piece placement.
